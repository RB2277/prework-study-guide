## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to review notes. You are also able to have suggestions for which topic to study first. You can access this by using the Chrome Devtools with either Comand+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). After this you can navigate to the console which will list the topics from the prework, along with a randomly selected topic.
